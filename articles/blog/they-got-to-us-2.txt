They Got to Us 2

<p>No, this is not a play on the title of the upcoming Naughty Dog game. But we might as well include it, as they spent a lot of time showcasing Ellie's non-binary sexual forays before anything else that might have been of interest to the audience. Oh, how brave!  No, what grinds my gears is the 'diversification' of characters in tabletop game artworks.</p>

<p>We're mainly talking about the insertion of women and black people in the wrong contexts, and ostensively so, while white males are nearly always villains or otherwise scrawny and looking a bit dumb. Long gone are the days when the words warrior or knight would conjure-up an image nigh identical to what people in the thirteenth century would have seen in their daily lives. Here we are, in the current year, when historical accuracy has become irrelevant and myths that defined culture are smudged on the altar of inclusivity so that future generations won't become Nazis or something.</p>

<h2>Magic: The Gathering of Strong Independent Women</h2>
<p>Have you noticed how nearly every goddamn soldier token is now a woman? I have heard once that a picture is worth a thousand rants. Therefore, I'll try and remain calm while showcasing a selection of handpicked cards that I extracted from a store's abandoned box in fewer than three minutes.</p>

<h2>Double-D Human Warriors</h2>
<p>Looking through the 5th Edition Player's Handbook you'll have a hard time spotting a white caucasian male; dwarves and elves don't count. If I didn't know better, I'd say that the white males of the Forgotten Realms have become extinct.</p>

<h2>Love Letter: Blacked Edition & Other Anachronic Achromatisms</h2>
<p>It is one thing to have black friends who play board games with you, but having black characters wearing medieval European attire is something else. I think it's called "Cultural Appropriation" if I'm not mistaken. But that's generally only a no-no for whites. So it's okay.</p>

<h2>Twilight Imperium and the Space Marinesses</h2>
<p>You could pull an excuse that warrior women in a fantasy setting are just that. However, it is generally accepted that Sci-fi is an extension of our current timeline and, most importantly, reality. But I'm probably wrong, as even Star Wars is just fantasy knights fighting with glow-sticks, in space; So I shouldn't take these things to heart.</p>

<p>I wonder how many black people are avid tabletop gamers. I also wonder how many gals would have been bothered if the guard from Love Letter would have been a man for a change. These race/gender transitions have only begun occurring in the last decade. It is a very recent trend, concurrent with the agitation of the far-left pundits, sympathizers and violent activists. Love & Peace ya'll!</p>
