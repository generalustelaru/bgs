        <p>No, this is not a play on the title of the upcoming Naughty Dog game. But we might as well include it, as they spent a lot of time showcasing Ellie's non-binary sexual forays before anything else that might have been of interest to the audience. Oh, how brave!  No, what grinds my gears is the 'diversification' of characters in tabletop game artwork.</p>

        <p>We're mainly talking about the insertion of women and black people in the wrong contexts, and ostensively so, while white males are nearly always villains or otherwise scrawny and looking a bit dumb. Long gone are the days when the words warrior or knight would conjure-up an image nigh identical to what people in the thirteenth century would have seen in their daily lives. Here we are, in the current year, when historical accuracy has become irrelevant and myths that defined culture are smudged on the altar of inclusivity so that future generations won't become Nazis or something.</p>

        <h2>Magic: The Gathering of Strong Independent Women</h2>
        <p>Have you noticed how nearly every goddamn soldier token is now a woman? Who cares about Eowyn when there's an Amazonian behind every second shield? What's so special about of Xena if women are draft material? Here I'm showcasing a selection I handpicked in under a minute from a store's M:TG box of abandoned cards.</p>

        <img class="articleImage" src="articles/blog/they-got-to-us-2_magic-gathering-of-strong-women.png" alt="">

        <h2>Double-D Human Soldiers</h2>
        <p>Looking through the 5th Edition Player's Handbook you'll have a hard time spotting a white caucasian male; dwarves and elves don't count. If I didn't know better, I'd say that the white males of the Forgotten Realms have become extinct. From fragile asian female bodies wearing heavy armor, to afro-warriors with platemail, D&D looks more like a high fever dream than anything else.</p>

        <img class="articleImage" src="articles/blog/they-got-to-us-2_dnd-perversion.png" alt="">

        <h2>Love Letter: Blacked Edition & Other Anachronic Achromatisms</h2>
        <p>It is one thing to have black friends who play board games with you, but having black characters wearing medieval European attire is something else. I think it's called "Cultural Appropriation" if I'm not mistaken. We have black WW1 soldiers, black fairy tale characters, black Centurions, and black Pharaohs. But that's generally only a no-no if whites are inserted where they don't belong. So it must be okay.</p>

        <img class="articleImage" src="articles/blog/they-got-to-us-2_love-letter-new-faces.png" alt="">

        <h2>Twilight Imperium and the Space Marinesses</h2>
        <p>You could pull an excuse that warrior women in a fantasy setting are just eye-candy. However, it is generally accepted that Sci-fi is an extension of our current timeline and, most importantly, reality. If technological progression is about the betterment of the human condition, why then would the 21st century find the most precious and delicate segment of the population in the front lines of an armed conflict? Aren't there enough brawny men, exoskeleton suits, and combat mechs around? Sure, there may be imaginary contexts where these considerations are out the window, but you would see that as an exception, not the rule. If the Feminist idea of an empowered woman is having her innards rearranged by an otherworldy abomination, I can't understand why they find animated tentacles so offensive. What's going on here?!</p>

        <h2>Miscegenation Nation</h2>
        <p>Name something more subversive than slipping images of interracial relations into children's reading material. Oh, I know, there are worse examples but, so you'll know, they're getting into geeky children books too. I'm just wondering, is that girl in the middle adopted, or the result random genetic selection?</p>

        <img class="articleImage" src="articles/blog/they-got-to-us-2_children-misgenation-propaganda.png" alt="">

        <p>I wonder how many black people are avid tabletop gamers. I also wonder how many gals would have been bothered if the guard from Love Letter would have been a man for a change. Who are we trying not to offend here?</p>
        <p>These race/gender transitions have only begun occurring in the last decade. It is a very recent trend, concurrent with the agitation of the far-left pundits, sympathizers and violent activists. It might not seem as much but, at this rate, future generations will no longer be able to understand History. Somebody is sowing confusion for a reason. This can't be happening out of the blue.</p>
        <p>I hope this didn't spoil your day. Have a nice one!</p>
