    <p>  <em>Christophe Pont's Colonial: Europe's Empires Overseas </em>  is an atypical 4x strategy game that aims to recreate some four hundred years of history, beginning from the Renaissance period and culminating around the Industrial Revolution, when Colonialism had reached its peak. </p>

    <p> As I see it, Colonial's main selling point is the way in which it treats this complex subject, using a minimum of game components and rules. Players use colored wooden disks for virtually everything they do. The player <em> Nation Boards </em>  have spaces for  <em> Treasury </em> ,  <em> Merchant Fleets </em> , and  <em> Naval Forces </em> , all of which are routinely moved or counted. On the game board, the discs determine player control and army size, they mark technological advancements and diplomatic relations, as well as represent  <em> Goods </em> and <em> Bank Loans. </em>  </p>

    <img class="articleImage" src="articles/colonial-europes-empires-overseas/colonial-europes-empires-overseas-nation-board-close-up.jpg" alt="Colonial - Nation board close-up">

    <p> The game begins with nations having their meager navies, modest treasuries and a couple of Merchant Fleets each, ready to make a profit.  </p>

    <p> During every game round, players will select, in secret, five of the twelve available actions, which are hard-coupled onto six cards. Then, one by one, players reveal these actions and resolve them in order, to the surprise of some, sometimes including their own. </p>

    <p> In summary, the actions are the following:
     <ul>
      <li> Explorer - rolls dice to explore new territories and gain  <em> Prestige </em>  (VP) </li>
      <li> Viceroy - puts discs as population on the map; most disks determines control </li>
      <li> Rebel - places <em> Unrest </em> and creates revolts in controlled territories (removal of disks) </li>
      <li> Misionary - places <em> Missions </em> to prevent revolts </li>
      <li> Merchant - pairs Merchant Fleets to controlled resources to ship <em> Goods </em> (place disks on market)  </li>
      <li> Trader - sells Market Goods (moves them to player treasuries)</li>
      <li> Governor - places a  <em> Booming City </em>  that forces Merchants to ship from its territory first </li>
      <li> Financeer - grants reambursable <em> Loans </em> with interest </li>
      <li> Conqueror - establishes  <em> Colonies </em>  in controlled territories to get Prestige and Treasury </li>
      <li> Sovereign - initiates war, ending with a transfer of Prestige and navy destruction or early surrender  </li>
      <li> Diplomat - raises diplomatic standing, which protects against war </li>
      <li> Scientist - permanently improves the effect of other actions </li>
     </ul>
    </p>

  <p> The Merchant Fleet is the essential component for creating the game's currency, and thus it is a privilege to obtain while being easy to lose. Between rounds, players can pay Treasury to purchase them, but only to the degree to which they have exclusive control over distinct resources on the board. Hence, rare resources will often be contested areas in a conflict of majorities, as Viceroy lets players add disks on any explored resource. </p>
    <p> However, the  <em> Explorer </em>  is probably the most critically important action that you can do in Colonial. When players explore, they roll ten custom dice, which have two success sides and four blank sides. If the result matches the target territory's exploration difficulty, they succeed at exploring and gain a Prestige Point in the process. Then they may gain control of one of the available resources by placing a disk. </p>

    <p> Being the first to gain <em> 10 </em> Prestige points is how you win* in Colonial. *That is if you also are free of bank debt. Generally speaking, you achieve that by maintaining a constant exploration effort sustained by trade. However, depending on the aggressiveness of other players, you might also have to establish Colonies to prevent Viceroy takeovers and build a strong Navy to safeguard your gained Prestige, as well as your Merchant Fleets from war. </p>

    <img class="articleImage" src="articles/colonial-europes-empires-overseas/colonial-europes-empires-overseas-board-close-up-australia.jpg" alt="Colonial game board - Australia">

    <p> Colonial also puts a strong emphasis on player cooperation and negotiation. The Missionary, Merchant, Trader, Diplomat, and Rebel actions allow players to interact at various levels beyond brute force or disk majority.

For example, a player may request to have his diplomatic standing raised by other players in exchange for Treasury. In this way, he may reach a safe level faster. The Merchant can also ship goods of other players, and the Trader can sell them, no matter whom they belong.

    <p> Therefore, controlling most resources establishes a passive form of income, at least while there is peace and nobody drops more disks over yours. That's why establishing Colonies is the best way of ensuring your control over your resources, as having strict colonial rule over a territory prevents all opponents from placing their disks. However, the larger a native population is, the longer it takes to build a presence large enough to trigger colonization. Once you've achieved it though, you are awarded a Prestige Point and also get to pillage the natives for a quick buck, gaining their eternal  <i>sympathy</i> and a little <em>Unrest</em>. Colonies protect your resources, but that does not guarantee your success. Boycotts and war can still hurt you.  </p>

    <p> Wars in Colonial function as a system of checks and balances - but only as long as players invest in their Naval Fleets regularly. If a player lags behind the arms race, he may very well become the target of extortion. He may have to pay tribute to avoid the obliteration of his Merchant Fleets, as well as contested resources. As the wars also end with the loser transferring a Prestige Point to the winner, you can see why having a strong military integrates perfectly into Colonial's economic system. </p>

    <p> Finally, for those who are struggling financially, there's always the credit option. Nations can survive and even thrive on bank loans alone. If no other player is willing to invest in your exploits, rest assured that your court  <em> Financier </em>  is more than happy to provide you with the amount you need, of course, within the bounds of your economy level, which also requires build-up. In exchange for Treasury, the Scientist can raise your expertise in any of four aspects: Economy, Navy, Logistics, and Navigation. </p>

    <img class="articleImage" src="articles/colonial-europes-empires-overseas/colonial-europes-empires-overseas-board-close-up-market.jpg" alt="Colonial board close-up, The Market">

    <p> As I have mentioned earlier, a player cannot win the game until he pays off all of his nation's debt. The longer you delay this, the harder it becomes, as interest rates start piling up and eventually suffocate your chances of winning. It seems that you can't achieve greatness through financial slavery. </p>

    <p> You can see why I adore the theme of Colonial. Yeah, sure, there are some unsavory aspects to deal with, such as the slavery theme, complete with rules for triangular trade, the suppression of native populations, the use of Jesuit missions to brainwash locals, and the subversive use of freedom fighters for your political and economic gains. The Age of Exploration is very ripe with innovations, wars, and dramas alike, and Colonial manages to incorporate most of it very well. </p>

    <p>  The game has many merits. The programmable action selection system requires a decent degree of forward-thinking, but not so much as to turn the game into a crawl, as I've experienced with  <em> Shogun </em>  and  <em> Wallenstein </em> . The multi-purpose player disks are also very neat. I suspect that Christophe Pont has drawn some inspiration from <em> Endeavor </em> , which was released just two years prior. </p>

    <p> However, in my opinion, the final product suffers greatly from a strategy imbalance. The Exploration system sits in stark contrast to the deterministic and multi-layered economic system, the latter being too slow to compete against a rush of successful exploration actions; At least for an important portion of the game. </p>

    <p> As Colonial is set to recreate the challenges of the Age of Exploration, basing geographical discovery on throwing a bunch of dice for free is beyond ludicrous; Why would a player ever think of colonizing China, a territory with an insane amount of native population just to get one Prestige, when simply exploring next-door Indochina yields the same reward?! </p>

    <p> In conclusion, despite the high diversity of actions and the potential for a highbrow diplomatic game, Colonial incentivizes players to focus on the most basic of strategies. It makes for a bittersweet experience and leaves the impression that the prototype barely saw a couple of plays, and that the Second Edition was also rushed. </p>

    <h2> Modding the Beast </h2>

    <p> Luckily, Colonial's premise has intrigued me ever since discovering it years ago. Already being a fan of Endeavor, I wanted something less abstracted, and Colonial seemed to be the perfect fit. I was well aware of the shortcomings of both of its editions, but I always felt that the whole package had the potential to be a great diplomatic and economic game. </p>



    <p> After looking around a bit through existing variants, I finally found  <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/119997/colonial-variant" target="_blank"> ONE </a>  that tried to nerf the Explorer. The creator, (BGG user Gubban) proposes that instead of rolling dice to meet a threshold, players should pay Treasury to match it. Then, instead of getting a Prestige, you would gain an <em> Exploration Token </em> , an item of no intrinsic value. </p>

    <p> The original concept resembles a race on each continent to gain the lead in Exploration Tokens and earn a few Prestige points that way, eliminating the cornucopia of Prestige that flows from Exploration in the official game. The variant also proposes a realistic barrier against discovering the American continent too early, where players have to deal multiplied exploration costs for everything that lies West of Spain, unless they spend time developing their Navigation level.

But the race for Exploration Tokens creates a system of perpetually contested Prestige, which, unfortunately, is not compatible with how wars work in Colonial. </p>

    <p> Hence I modified the variant, transforming the Exploration Tokens (ET's) into plain fractions of Prestige (1/3). During set-up, each territory is filled with a number ET's and Prestige that match their exploration difficutly (1 token for level 3 difficulty, 2 tokens for level 4, and so on). Furthermore, I equated the Prestige/BT reward for colony establishment with the number of native symbols present. In this way there would be incentives to go for large targets... like China. </p>

    <p>True to my expectations, when I tried out this variant, there were early incursions into Africa, early colonies established in India and China (which are a complete waste of resources in the standard game), and a proper, delayed discovery of America. In a sentence, this modified variant makes Colonial (2nd Ed.) worthy of being one of the best games about Exploration and Colonisation out there, or, at least, I have the confidence to bring it out at any medium-heavy game night and also to recommend it to others. </p>
